    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a <b>Senior Data / AI / Cloud Engineer</b> currently working at GARAIO AG, placed as a
        <b>Data Engineer at SBB</b> (Swiss Federal Railways) in Bern, Switzerland. I bring over
        <b>20 years of experience</b> across a diverse range of languages, platforms, and roles — from
        Java and C# through to Python, and from desktop GUIs to large-scale distributed SOA systems.
        <br><br>
        My current focus is on <b>data engineering, AI, and cloud</b>. I hold a
        <b>Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence</b> from the University of Bath, and have completed a
        <b>CAS in Advanced Machine Learning</b> and a <b>CAS in NLP</b> at the University of Bern.
        I have earned multiple <b>Microsoft Azure certifications</b> in AI and data analytics. I am an active
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> participant and am actively building
        NLP / transformer prototypes and integrating OpenAI APIs into real-world projects.
        <br><br>
        My analytical foundation comes from a <b>Theoretical and Mathematical Physics degree from the
        University of Edinburgh</b>. Throughout my career I have progressed from developer to
        architect, technical lead, technical manager, CTO, and mentor — including within the
        <b>Berlin start-up scene</b> at companies like Next Big Thing AG and as co-founder of Infiindia.
        <br><br>
        I believe strongly in design patterns, unit testing, clean code, and sound methodology,
        regardless of the technology stack. I am fluent in <b>English</b> and <b>German</b>.
